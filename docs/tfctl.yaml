# tfctl configuration is made in this document. It should be placed in one of
# the directories as specified in configuration.md.  There are two sections -
# GLOBAL and COMMAND-SPECIFIC.

#
# TFCTL GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
#

# The top-level `defaults`` argument set is reserved and defines arguments that
# are added into every command line. For example, with the configuration below,
# the command `tfctl sq --color` will effectively become `tfctl sq --padding 1
# --titles --color`. Note that global defaults arguments are the least
# precedent and are overridden by both command-specific config and command line
# arguments. So, for example, `tfctl sq --no-titles` would "cancel out" the
# global `--titles` argument, but `--padding 1` would still be in effect.
defaults:
  - --padding 1
  - --titles

# Similar to the global "defaults" set, the "nostate" set is reserved and
# defines arguments that are added into every command line THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE
# STATE. Currently all commands except "sq" are considered "nostate" and will,
# therefore, have these arguments injected. Note that these arguments have a
# higher precedent than "global" arguments, but lower than command-specific
# arguments and command line arguments. For example, with the configuration
# below, the command `tfctl oq` will effectively become `tfctl oq --host
# app.terraform.io --org tfctl`.
nostate:
  - --host app.terraform.io
  - --org tfctl

#
# COMMAND-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION
#

# Each of the commands (mq, oq, sq, etc) can have their own configuration
# section. Each section is made up of one or more "sets", which are, in turn,
# a list of command line arguments to automatically use for that command. The
# set identifier `defaults` is reserved and is automatically injected into every
# command line for it's parent command. Any arguments in a set can explicitly be
# overriden on the command line.
#
# In this example, all sq command lines will automatically be injected with the
# `--padding 2` and `--short` options. So, the entered command line `tfctl sq`
# will effectively become `tfctl sq --padding 2 --short`.  If the user enters
# `tfctl sq --padding 4`, the effective command line will be `tfctl sq
# --padding 4 --short`, since command line arguments override set arguments.
#
# Alternate argument sets can be specified using the '@set' syntax on the
# command line. For example, `tfctl sq @example` will inject the arguments from
# the `example`` set in addition to the `defaults`` set. So, `tfctl sq` will
# become `tfctl sq --padding 2 --short --color --sort id`.
#
# Note that argument sets can be specified as YAML collections (`defaults`) or
# as a single string (`example`).
sq:
  defaults:
    - --padding 2
    - --short

  example: --color --sort id

#
# ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION
#

cache:
  # Number of hours after which cached state file info is considered stale and
  # removed from the cache. Note that cache cleaning occurs even if caching is
  # disabled. Set to 0 to disable automatic cleaning.
  clean: 24

  # Caching of raw state file info used by, currently, only the sq command can
  # be enabled or disabled here. By default it is disabled. This setting can
  # be overriden by the TFCTL_CACHE environment variable.
  enabled: false
# Colors to use for --output=text --colors. They must be set here and cannot be
# changed on the command line.  Valid #rrggbb HTML codes only.
# colors:
#   title: "#b58900"
#   even: "#ffffff"
#   odd: "#859900"
